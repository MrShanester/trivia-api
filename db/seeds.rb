# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Question.create!([{question: "Who is the best friend of all the friends?", answer: "Shane!"}, {question: "Who made this website?", answer: "Shane!"}, {question: "Who has a beautiful golden mane?", answer: "Shane!"}, {question: "Who is increasingly coming off as an extreme narcissist?", answer: "Shane!"}])

# Option.create!([{question_id: 1, option: "Shane!"}, {question_id: 1, option: "Tanner!"}, {question_id: 1, option: "Alex!"}, {question_id: 1, option: "Ome!"}, {question_id: 2, option: "Shane!"}, {question_id: 2, option: "Tanner!"}, {question_id: 2, option: "Alex!"}, {question_id: 2, option: "Ome!"}, {question_id: 3, option: "Shane!"}, {question_id: 3, option: "Tanner!"}, {question_id: 3, option: "Alex!"}, {question_id: 3, option: "Ome!"}, {question_id: 4, option: "Shane!"}, {question_id: 4, option: "Tanner!"}, {question_id: 4, option: "Alex!"}, {question_id: 4, option: "Ome!"}])
